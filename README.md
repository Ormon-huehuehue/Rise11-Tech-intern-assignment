# Rise11-Tech-intern-assignment

Overview
The webpage was built using Next.js

Approach:-

Planning: I started by carefully reviewing the provided design mockup and understanding the different sections and functionality required for the claims processing workflow.
UI Layout: 
Component Design: I broke down the UI into reusable components, such as the sidebar, navigation bar, progress bar, the claims filing form, and the document upload sections. This allows for better maintainability and easier testing.
Styling: I utilized Tailwind CSS to ensure a consistent and responsive design across the application.
Error Handling: I added robust error handling and validation to the claims filing form to provide a seamless user experience and ensure data integrity.
Deployment: I finally deployed the project on Vercel.
